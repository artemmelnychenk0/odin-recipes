    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a Bulgarian variant of moussaka that my family makes.</p>
    <p>It has a great test so you can feel the real Bulgarian culture</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ pound ground beef (85% lean)</li>
        <li>¾ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and ground pork and cook until brown and crumbly, 5
            to 10 minutes. Drain and discard fat. Add 1/4 cup olive oil, carrot, onion, celery, parsley stems, and
            tomatoes. Mix to combine. Stir in bell pepper and season with paprika, salt, pepper, bay leaves, and cayenne
            pepper. Cook until vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer meat mixture to a large baking pan.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet and cook potatoes until lightly browned, about 10
            minutes. Transfer to the baking pan and mix well with the meat mixture.</li>
    </ol>
